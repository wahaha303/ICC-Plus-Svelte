            A. Download the Viewer from the link below. Then, open the <b>JSON</b> file of the project and the <b>app.XXXXXXX.js</b> file in a text editor such as Notepad. Copy all contents from your project and paste them into the space between /*! Delete ~ */ and /*! End */ in the js file.

            <b>OR</b>

            B. Download the Viewer from the link below. Get your project <b>JSON</b> file and make sure it is named <b>project.json</b>. Place this file next to the <b>index.html</b> file inside the Viewer folder.
            Note: This method will not work when running locally from your computerâ€”it must be uploaded to a hosting service. However, once it's hosted, you can easily update your project by simply replacing the project file. This is the more convenient and scalable solution.

            <b>Next:</b>

            Create a user on Neocities or another free hosting service, move to the 'Edit your page' part of the site and upload the Viewer, anyone that enters the page will now see the CYOA.

                In the top menu of the Viewer Mode, you will see a button labeled "Download image". Click this button to start downloading the image of your project. The larger your project is, the longer it may take for the download to begin, and the bigger the resulting file will be.

                If your project is too large, it will be automatically split into multiple image files. If you see <i>\'_part\'</i> at the end of the downloading file names, please do not leave the page until all parts have finished downloading.

                If the image doesn\'t download properly or other issues occur, it might be wiser to use an extension with more options, such as <a href="https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/" target="_blank">Awesome Screenshot</a>, which allows you to save your project as a PDF or capture only a specific part of it.`

Placing a repeating image in the background that fits the theme is always a good idea.

        Create the point system if you have one, it's not necessary, you can always go for the 'select x from each row' type of Cyoa. Now create the rows you have planned before-hand, give them names, and add any choices you have planned.`

        title: 'What is a requirement and how do I create one?',

        A requirement can be added to a row by pressing the key+ symbol in the right corner, and on the choice by pressing the button that says 'Requirement'.

        When one of these buttons is pressed you a dialog opens up where you have to choose what condition you'll want.

        <b>Add Global Requirement</b>:
        - Use the Global Requirement defined in Manage Global Requirement.
        <b>Add Word Requirement</b>:
        - Insert a requirement to compare the current value of the word (Text to replace id with).
        <b>Add Selected Choice Requirement</b>:
        - Insert a requirement to check whether the user has selected the choice with the specified id.
        - If the choice can be selected multiple times, you can append /ON#Number after the id to check whether it has been selected at least a certain number of times (e.g., choice-id/ON#2).
        <b>Add Non-Selected Choice Requirement</b>:
        - Insert a requirement to check whether the user has not selected the choice with the specified id.
        <b>Add Point Requirement</b>
        - Insert a requirement to compare the current value of the Point-type.
        <b>Add Point Comparison Requirement</b>
        - Insert a requirement to compare the values of two Point-types.
        - Arithmetic operations can be added to the Point-type located on the right-hand side.
        <b>'X of These is Selected' Requirement</b>
        - Insert a requirement to check whether the user has selected at least X choices with the specified id.
        <b>'X of These is Not Selected' Requirement</b>
        - Insert a requirement to check whether the user has selected fewer than X choices with the specified id.
        <b>'Selected X or more From' Requirements</b>
        - Insert a requirement to check whether the user has selected at least X choices among those included in the Group / Row / All Rows.


        More than one of these requirements can be added to each row, choice, addon, score and requirement.`

These can be created in the dialog that pops up when you press the 'Feature' button in the top menu and can be added to choices by pressing the 'Score' button on a choice.

        In the 'Point Type' select you choose the point-type you have created, the value which needs to be in the negative if you want it to give the player points, and the text that will be shown before and after.

        If the 'Show Score?' checkbox is unchecked then the value and text will not show on the choice, in case you want to write it in the text or you want it to be hidden.`

        An example will be that the 'Manage Filters' button will let you change the look of the deactivated and activated filters, and the 'Text' button will let you change the color, size, and font of the different texts on the page.

        Each row can have different designs if you press the Cog in the right corner of the row and flips the switch 'Use private styling?' in the dialog that pops up. Now the styling of the row will be whatever you change in the buttons that show up under.`

        title: 'What is variables used for?',
        text: `At this point, variables can only be used with button rows and can be attached to a button when it is created.

The 'Allowed Choices' decides how many choices that the player can select at one time, write 1 in the text field and the user may only choose one. If there is no limit then let it stay 0.

        The 'Selected Choices' will show how many that is currently selected, and should normally be 0, if it is something else and none is selected then some wonky shit has happened, and you can clear it by changing the value to 0.
        `
    }, {
        title: 'What does the three switches on a row do?',
        text: `The three switches in the row when it is on edit-mode changes how the rows operate when pressed.

        The first one named 'Button?' will switch the image of the row out with a button, which in turn can be used to activate or deactivate variables, whose ids can be used in requirements.

        The second button will make it impossible for a player to change any of the choices, if one is selected then it will stay selected and visa versa. Good to use when the user should be given information or story, and not choices.

        The third button named 'Selected Choices?' can be used to make the row show all choices that have been selected, good to use at the end of the project to let the player see the choices they have made. A private row design should be used to make filters invisible.`
    }, {
        title: 'What is an Addon?',
        text: `An Addon is going to be a smaller choice in the choices but is currently only an under title and undertext of the choice it is attached to.`

        title: 'What is the image cropper and compressor?',
        text: `The image cropper and compressor can be found when someone presses the 'Change Image'-button on either a row or a choice and will open up in its own dialog.

        The cropper lets you change the height and width aspect of your image, and cut off parts that you don't need. To change the aspect you'll have to change the value of the two text fields, and then press the 'Change Aspect'-button. To crop the image you need to press the 'Crop Image'-button.

        The compressor cuts down the size of the image at the cost of its quality, which everyone should do to keep the project file small and thus the same with the bandwidth and storage cost. The image quality and the image scale text field shows the percentage to cut down to in quality and scale.

        Cutting down to 40sih percent quality will make little visible difference in most cases, but shave off up to 60-70 percent of the image file size.`
